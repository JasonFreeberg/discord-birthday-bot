# Discord Birthday Bot

A simple Discord Bot to show how to interact with REST APIs. Uses a JSON file to hold your friends' names and birthdays. The bot runs once per day with GitHub Actions, reads the file, and send a message to the main chat on the Discord server letting everyone know that someone's birthday is coming up!
